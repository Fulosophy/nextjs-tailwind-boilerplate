## Introduction

NextJS preconfigured boiler plate with TailwindUI / CSS

Uses Experimental APP DIR and TSX out of the box.

This boiler plate uses Tailwind CSS and Tailwind UI https://tailwindcss.com/ || https://tailwindui.com

While TailwindCSS is completely free, Tailwind UI only has a few free components. To get all access to tailwind UI components -> https://tailwindui.com/all-access
You can also use https://tailwinduikit.com/ components as there are many more free ones on here.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or

```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
